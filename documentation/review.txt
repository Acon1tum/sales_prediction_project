# Research Defense Presentation Guide (Based on train.py)

## 1. Introduction

### Objective:
Explain the purpose of your project:
- "This project aims to develop a machine learning model to predict café sales, enabling better decision-making and resource allocation."
- "The model helps optimize inventory management, staffing levels, and marketing strategies through accurate sales forecasting."

### Problem Statement:
Highlight the problem you're solving:
- "Accurate sales forecasting is critical for inventory management, staffing, and marketing, but traditional methods often lack precision."
- "Businesses struggle with:
  * Over/under-stocking of inventory
  * Inefficient staff scheduling
  * Ineffective marketing budget allocation
  * Inability to respond quickly to market changes"

### Proposed Solution:
Introduce your solution:
- "We developed a linear regression-based system that uses historical sales data and external factors like weather and promotions to predict sales."
- "Key features:
  * 19 carefully selected input features
  * Standardized data preprocessing
  * Efficient linear regression model
  * Comprehensive visualization tools
  * Real-time prediction capabilities"

## 2. Methodology

### Data Preparation:
Explain how the `load_data` method processes the dataset:
- Loads data from a CSV file with the following steps:
  * Reads raw sales data
  * Removes non-numeric columns (Date, Product Name)
  * Handles missing values using mean imputation
  * Separates features (`X`) and target (`y`)
  * Preserves feature names for interpretability

### Model Architecture:
Describe the linear regression model created in the `create_model` method:
- Input layer for 19 sales-related features:
  * Units Sold
  * Unit Price
  * Discount Applied (%)
  * Foot Traffic
  * Social Media Engagement
  * Ad Spend (₱)
  * Holiday indicators
  * Local Event indicators
  * Category indicators
  * Weather conditions
- Single Dense layer with linear activation (no activation function)
- Output layer for predicting sales
- Training configuration:
  * Adam optimizer with learning rate 0.001
  * Mean Squared Error loss function
  * Mean Absolute Error metric

### Training Process:
Explain the `train_model` method:
- Data preprocessing:
  * StandardScaler for input features (zero mean, unit variance)
  * MinMaxScaler for target values (scaled to [0,1] range)
- Data splitting:
  * 80% training set
  * 20% test set
  * Random state fixed for reproducibility
- Model training:
  * 200 epochs
  * Batch size of 32
  * Validation split of 20%
  * Progress tracking and visualization

### Evaluation Metrics:
Discuss the metrics used in `evaluate_model`:
- **MAE (Mean Absolute Error)**:
  * Measures average prediction error
  * Easy to interpret in original units
  * Less sensitive to outliers
- **RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error)**:
  * Penalizes larger errors more heavily
  * Same units as the target variable
  * Useful for comparing models
- **R² (R-squared)**:
  * Indicates proportion of variance explained
  * Range: 0 to 1 (higher is better)
  * Helps assess model fit
