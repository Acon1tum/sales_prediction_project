# Research Defense Presentation Guide (Based on train.py)

## 1. Introduction

### Objective:
Explain the purpose of your project:
- "This project aims to develop a machine learning model to predict café sales, enabling better decision-making and resource allocation."

### Problem Statement:
Highlight the problem you're solving:
- "Accurate sales forecasting is critical for inventory management, staffing, and marketing, but traditional methods often lack precision."

### Proposed Solution:
Introduce your solution:
- "We developed a neural network-based system that uses historical sales data and external factors like weather and promotions to predict sales."

## 2. Methodology

### Data Preparation:
Explain how the `load_data` method processes the dataset:
- Loads data from a CSV file.
- Cleans the data by removing non-numeric columns and filling missing values.
- Separates features (`X`) and target (`y`).
- Show a sample of the dataset (e.g., columns like "Units Sold," "Unit Price," etc.).

### Model Architecture:
Describe the neural network created in the `create_model` method:
- Input layer for features.
- Two hidden layers with 64 and 32 neurons, using techniques like regularization, batch normalization, and dropout to prevent overfitting.
- Output layer for predicting sales.
- Highlight the use of an exponential decay learning rate for optimization.

### Training Process:
Explain the `train_model` method:
- Scales the data using `StandardScaler`.
- Splits the data into training and testing sets.
- Trains the model with early stopping to prevent overfitting.
- Tracks training history for visualization.

### Evaluation Metrics:
Discuss the metrics used in `evaluate_model`:
- **MAE**: Measures average prediction error.
- **RMSE**: Penalizes larger errors more heavily.
- **R²**: Indicates how well the model explains the variance in sales.

## 3. Results

### Model Performance:
Present the evaluation metrics (e.g., MAE, RMSE, R²) calculated in `evaluate_model`:
- Highlight key findings, such as "The model achieved an R² score of 0.85, explaining 85% of the variance in sales."

### Visualizations:
Show the visualizations generated by the `visualize_metrics`, `visualize_training_history`, and `visualize_predictions` methods:
- **Training History**: Loss and MAE over epochs.
- **Prediction Accuracy**: Actual vs. predicted sales scatter plot.
- **Feature Importance**: Bar chart showing the most influential features.

### Top Features:
Discuss the top 5 features identified by the `feature_importance_plot` function.

---

## 4. Demonstration

### Live Prediction:
Use the example input from the `main` function to demonstrate a prediction:
- Show how the system predicts sales based on these inputs.
- Example: "For 100 units sold at a 10% discount on a sunny day, the model predicts sales of ₱5,000."

## 5. Discussion

### Strengths:
Highlight the strengths of your approach:
- **Scalability**: Can handle large datasets.
- **Accuracy**: Uses advanced techniques like regularization and early stopping.
- **Interpretability**: Provides feature importance and visualizations.

### Limitations:
Acknowledge limitations:
- Relies on historical data, which may not capture future trends.
- Potential biases in the dataset.

### Future Work:
Suggest improvements:
- Integrate real-time data for dynamic predictions.
- Expand the model to other industries or product categories.

## 6. Conclusion

### Summarize the key takeaways:
- "This project demonstrates the feasibility of using machine learning for accurate sales forecasting, providing actionable insights for business decision-making."

### Emphasize the impact of your work:
- "By leveraging this system, businesses can optimize inventory, reduce waste, and improve profitability."
