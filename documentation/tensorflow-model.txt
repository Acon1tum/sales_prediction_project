The Keras linear regression model is pre-loaded during the initialization of the application to ensure efficient sales forecasting operations. Here's a detailed explanation:

What Does Pre-loading Mean?
    Pre-loading the Keras model involves loading the trained machine learning model into memory when the application starts, rather than loading it every time a forecast request is made. This approach reduces latency and improves the responsiveness of the application.

How It Works in the Code
Model Path Setup:
    - The path to the trained Keras model (keras_model.keras) is defined during the initialization phase of the application.
    - Example:
        MODEL_PATH = os.path.join(MODEL_DIR, "keras_model.keras")

Model Architecture:
    - The model is built using Keras 3.9.0
    - It is a linear regression model implemented as a Sequential model with:
        - Input layer accepting 19 sales-related features
        - Single Dense layer with linear activation (no activation function)
    - Training configuration:
        - Optimizer: Adam with learning rate 0.001
        - Loss function: Mean Squared Error
        - Metric: Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
    - Data preprocessing:
        - Input features are scaled using StandardScaler
        - Target values (sales) are scaled using MinMaxScaler

Model Loading:
    - The tf.keras.models.load_model() function is used to load the pre-trained model from the specified path.
    - Example:
        model = tf.keras.models.load_model(MODEL_PATH)

Error Handling:
    If the model file is missing or there is an issue during loading, the application logs an error and sets the model variable to None. This ensures the application does not crash and can handle the error gracefully.

Scalers and Feature Names:
    Along with the model, additional components are loaded:
        - Input scaler (StandardScaler) for normalizing input features
        - Output scaler (MinMaxScaler) for denormalizing predictions
        - Feature names for proper input mapping
    These are essential for preprocessing the input data and interpreting the model's output.

Why Pre-load the Model?
    Performance:
        Loading the model once during application startup avoids the overhead of repeatedly loading it for each request. This significantly reduces the time required to generate sales forecasts.

    Resource Optimization:
        By keeping the model in memory, the application avoids repeated disk I/O operations, which can be slow and resource-intensive.

    Scalability:
        Pre-loading the model ensures that the application can handle multiple forecast requests concurrently without delays caused by model loading.

    Error Detection:
        Loading the model at startup allows the application to detect issues (e.g., missing model file, corrupted model) early, rather than during runtime when a user makes a request.

Example Workflow
    When the application starts, the Keras linear regression model is loaded into memory.
    When a user uploads sales data and requests a forecast:
        - The input features are preprocessed using the loaded StandardScaler
        - The pre-loaded model is used to generate predictions
        - The predictions are post-processed using the MinMaxScaler
        - The final sales predictions are returned to the user

Benefits for Sales Forecasting
    Low Latency: Users experience faster response times since the model is already in memory.
    Reliability: The application ensures the model is available and functional before handling user requests.
    Consistency: All requests use the same instance of the model, ensuring consistent sales predictions.
    By pre-loading the Keras linear regression model, the application achieves a balance between performance, reliability, and scalability, making it well-suited for real-time sales forecasting tasks.
