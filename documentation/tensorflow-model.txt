The TensorFlow model is pre-loaded during the initialization of the application to ensure efficient forecasting operations. Here's a detailed explanation:

What Does Pre-loading Mean?
    Pre-loading the TensorFlow model involves loading the trained machine learning model into memory when the application starts, rather than loading it every time a forecast request is made. This approach reduces latency and improves the responsiveness of the application.

How It Works in the Code
Model Path Setup:
    - The path to the trained TensorFlow model (keras_model.keras) is defined during the initialization phase of the application.
    - Example:
        MODEL_PATH = os.path.join(MODEL_DIR, "keras_model.keras")


Model Loading:
    - The tf.keras.models.load_model() function is used to load the pre-trained model from the specified path.
    - Example:
        model = tf.keras.models.load_model(MODEL_PATH)


Error Handling:
    If the model file is missing or there is an issue during loading, the application logs an error and sets the model variable to None. This ensures the application does not crash and can handle the error gracefully.


Scalers and Feature Names:
    Along with the model, additional components like input (scaler_X) and output (scaler_y) scalers, as well as feature names, are also loaded. These are essential for preprocessing the input data and interpreting the model's output.


Why Pre-load the Model?
    Performance:
        Loading the model once during application startup avoids the overhead of repeatedly loading it for each request. This significantly reduces the time required to generate forecasts.

    Resource Optimization:
        By keeping the model in memory, the application avoids repeated disk I/O operations, which can be slow and resource-intensive.

    Scalability:
        Pre-loading the model ensures that the application can handle multiple forecast requests concurrently without delays caused by model loading.

    Error Detection:
        Loading the model at startup allows the application to detect issues (e.g., missing model file, corrupted model) early, rather than during runtime when a user makes a request.


Example Workflow
    When the application starts, the TensorFlow model is loaded into memory.
    When a user uploads data and requests a forecast:
    The input data is preprocessed using the loaded scalers.
    The pre-loaded model is used to generate predictions.
    The predictions are post-processed and returned to the user.


Benefits for Forecasting
    Low Latency: Users experience faster response times since the model is already in memory.
    Reliability: The application ensures the model is available and functional before handling user requests.
    Consistency: All requests use the same instance of the model, ensuring consistent predictions.
    By pre-loading the TensorFlow model, the application achieves a balance between performance, reliability, and scalability, making it well-suited for real-time forecasting tasks.
