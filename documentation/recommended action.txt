The "Stock Needed" figure in the "Recommended Actions" section of your forecast page appears high, even with a declining sales trend, because of how it's currently calculated.
Looking at the forecast.js file, specifically the updateDecisions function, the "Stock Needed" is based on the cumulative "Period Sales" up to that specific day, not just the individual day's forecasted sales.
Here's a breakdown:
Period Sales Calculation: The "Period Sales" shown in each recommendation card is a running total of the forecasted sales from Day 1 up to the current day of the recommendation.
For Day 1: Period Sales = Forecasted Sales (Day 1)
For Day 2: Period Sales = Forecasted Sales (Day 1) + Forecasted Sales (Day 2)
For Day 3: Period Sales = Forecasted Sales (Day 1) + Forecasted Sales (Day 2) + Forecasted Sales (Day 3)
And so on.
Stock Needed Calculation: The "Stock Needed" is then calculated based on this cumulative "Period Sales".
If the trend is positive: Stock Needed = Cumulative Period Sales * 1.2 (20% buffer)
If the trend is negative (as in your example): Stock Needed = Cumulative Period Sales * 0.8 (reduced by 20%)
In your example:
Day 1:
Expected Sales (Day 1): ₱835.79
Period Sales (Cumulative): ₱835.79
Stock Needed: ₱835.79 \* 0.8 ≈ 669 units
Day 2:
Expected Sales (Day 2): ₱998.18
Period Sales (Cumulative): ₱835.79 (Day 1) + ₱998.18 (Day 2) = ₱1,833.97
Stock Needed: ₱1,833.97 \* 0.8 ≈ 1,468 units
Day 3:
Expected Sales (Day 3): ₱1062.61
Period Sales (Cumulative): ₱1,833.97 (Cumulative Day 2) + ₱1062.61 (Day 3) = ₱2,896.58
Stock Needed: ₱2,896.58 \* 0.8 ≈ 2,318 units
So, even though the individual daily forecast might show a decline compared to a threshold, the stockNeeded reflects the quantity to cover sales over the entire period shown so far in the recommendations, adjusted by the trend of the current day.
The text "Expected sales: X" refers to that specific day's sales, while "Period Sales" and "Stock Needed" are based on the cumulative sum up to that day. This difference in reference (daily vs. cumulative) is why "Stock Needed" can seem high relative to the individual day's "Expected sales" when the trend is negative but previous days had sales.
If you'd prefer "Stock Needed" to reflect a quantity based more directly on the individual day's forecast or a shorter forward-looking window, the calculation in forecast.js would need to be adjusted.
The 1.2 and 0.8 multipliers in the stockNeeded calculation within your backend/static/js/forecast.js file are used to adjust the stock recommendation based on the predicted sales trend. Here's the breakdown:

d.trend === 'positive' (Positive Sales Trend): periodSales * 1.2
When the trend for the decision (d.trend) is 'positive', the periodSales (which is the cumulative forecasted sales up to that day) is multiplied by 1.2.
Explanation: This adds a 20% buffer to the stock needed.
Why?
Safety Stock/Anticipating Growth: If sales are trending upwards, it's prudent to have more stock on hand than just the bare forecast. This buffer helps to:
Meet potentially higher-than-forecasted demand if the positive trend accelerates.
Avoid stockouts, which can lead to lost sales and dissatisfied customers.
Capitalize fully on the growing demand.
Forecast Inaccuracy: Sales forecasts are estimates. A positive trend might indicate that the forecast could even be underestimating actual sales, so a buffer helps account for this uncertainty.
d.trend !== 'positive' (Typically Negative or Neutral Trend): periodSales * 0.8
When the trend is not 'positive' (which in the context of your actionType logic usually means 'negative' or 'neutral' when this calculation is hit with 'negative'), the periodSales is multiplied by 0.8.
Explanation: This reduces the stock needed by 20% compared to the cumulative forecasted sales.
Why?
Risk Mitigation/Avoiding Overstock: If sales are trending downwards or are stagnant but with a negative outlook for the specific decision, holding stock based on the full cumulative forecast (which includes past, potentially higher sales days) could lead to overstocking. Reducing by 20% is a more conservative approach to:
Minimize holding costs for excess inventory.
Reduce the risk of stock becoming obsolete or needing to be sold at a deep discount if demand continues to fall.
Align inventory levels more closely with the anticipated lower demand.
Adjusting for Decline: It's an acknowledgment that simply carrying stock for all previously forecasted sales might not be wise if the immediate outlook is poor.
In Summary:
The 1.2 and 0.8 multipliers are heuristics used to implement a basic inventory management strategy directly within the recommendations:
1.2 (Increase by 20%): Be prepared for growth when the trend is positive.
0.8 (Decrease by 20%): Be cautious and potentially reduce stock when the trend is negative.
These percentages (20% up or down) are common starting points for such adjustments. In a more sophisticated system, these percentages might be dynamic, based on factors like product volatility, lead times, or the confidence level of the forecast. For your application, they provide a straightforward way to make the "Stock Needed" recommendation more responsive to the predicted short-term sales direction.
